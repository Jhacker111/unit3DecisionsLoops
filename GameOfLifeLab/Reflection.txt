Grid will be 30x30. 
Live cells are rocks
Dead cells are empty
It is a predetermined pattern that sort of explodes then is stagnant
It runs through 4 iterations that happen 1 sec apart and shows the final result
At the edge, the program will see if it's valid and if it isn't then it just wont put it down.

REFLECTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This lab kicked my a** to be honest. I couldn't figure out the gridworld for the life of me and honestly didn't know where to go.
My number one reccomendation to future students is ask questions early. I had no idea what I was doing until I skyped with my friend who
is a developer and had him explain what I had to do. I learned that Java is frustrating but documentation helps a ton. I liked the game;
it is an hard concept to grasp at first but once you get over that hill it's pretty easy. I didn't like the gridworld documentation and 
how I would try something and it would throw an error, but that's programming I guess.
